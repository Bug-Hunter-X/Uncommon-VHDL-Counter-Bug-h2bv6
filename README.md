# Uncommon VHDL Counter Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a simple VHDL counter. The counter is designed to count from 0 to 15, but due to a potential oversight (in the conditional assignment), it might exhibit unexpected behavior. This example highlights the importance of carefully reviewing even simple VHDL code to avoid runtime problems. The `corrected_counter.vhdl` file provides a fixed version.
